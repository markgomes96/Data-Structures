1. This client program solves the prolem of managing and recording the sale of a bunch of books.

2. This program takes 3 input files in the formate [program] [master file] [transaction file] [new master file].
    The master file holds the current record of book data.
    The transaction file holds the list of transactions to be preformed on master file.
    The new master file holds the updated recored of book data.

The program outputs a [new master file] and an [ERROR file].
    The new master file is described above.
    The ERROR file holds a list of all errors produced from preforming list of transactions.

3. Client Program Algorithm 
    1. Copy master file to copy file
    2. Read in/open infile and outfile to copy file, infile to transaction file, infile to error file
    3. Loop through all transaction records
        4. Based on transaction type, preform transaction on copy file
            4a. To add a file, check if isbn exist. If not then add record to end of copy file.
            4b. To delete a file, check if isbn exist. If it does then find file, and mark its isbn with -1 for deletion.
            4c. To change on hand, check if isbn exist. If it does find file, read in record, modify record with 
                    transaction record and write it back to copy file.
            4d. To change price, repeat process [4c], but instead modify price field
    
    5. Copy updated copy file to new master file
