B-Tree Analysis

The goal of this assignment is to implement a B-tree of type Album.
One program creates the B-tree, and the other program handles insertions and search requests from transaction file.

The B-tree has an order of 5.
The B-tree is stored in the form of a binary index file, holding a series of type BTnode.
The first node stored has adress of root node in child[0], which is always in RAM.

*BTnode
BTnode should keep track of root node, root node address on disk, B-tree index file name,
file pointer to index file, height of tree

*createBT.cpp
Takes sequential file name and B-tree file
Reads all records and inserts them into the tree
Print out preorder traveral of keys in tree by height

*updateBT.cpp
Take B-tree file and transaction file(similar to proj 2)
Print out how many times it did a write and read
